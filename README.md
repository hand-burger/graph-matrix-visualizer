# Graph Plotter

This is a Python tool developed for MAT344 - Intro to Combinatorics project. It allows you to plot graphs, obtain their adjacency matrices, and find the eigenvalues.

## Installation

To use this tool, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `tkinter`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install tkinter
```

## Usage

To run the Graph Plotter, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Once the tool is running, you can perform the following actions:

- Left-click on the canvas to plot a vertex.
- Right-click on the canvas to plot an edge between two vertices.
- Click on the "Save graph" button to save the graph's adjacency matrix and display its eigenvalues.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Graph Plotter:
